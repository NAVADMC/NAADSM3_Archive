              The time period over which to compare recent new infections.  For
              example, a value of 14 days would mean to divide the number of
              new infections in the last 14 days vs. the number of new
              infections in the 14 days prior to that.

                          The source and target units of infections.  This
                          variable gives a comma separated list of 'a->b'
                          items, where 'a' is the source of the infection and
                          'b' is the target.  For initially infected units, the
                          'a->' is omitted.  'a' and 'b' are not unit IDs;
                          rather, they would be a 0 to indicate the first unit
                          in the list, a 1 to indicate the second, and so on.
                          The list is emptied each time it is reported, so this
                          variable gives new infections for each reporting
                          interval (e.g., day, week).  This variable is needed
                          if infections are to appear in the exposures and
                          infections table.  WARNING: this variable can produce
                          a large amount of output and should be turned off
                          when doing large numbers of Monte Carlo trials.
